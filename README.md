# Cross-Domain-Learning-for-Pulmonary-Nodule-Detection

#We propose a novel deep learning approach for pulmonary nodule detection in the presence of class imbalance.

#We apply the Gestalt principle of similarity for selecting visually similar objects from real-world to learn from as a pretraining procedure. Our approach seeks to bring in “explainability” into the transfer learning process by pre-training on visually relevant objects only.

#We have involved human subjects or annotators to select the most visually similar structures to lung nodules and non-nodules, paving way for human-interactive learning mechanisms.
